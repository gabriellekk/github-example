    "The purpose of this project is to allow for families to make informed and smart choices upon moving to neighborhoods in Scarborough, Toronto. For families moving to this particular region in Canada, they would probably be uprooting their previous lives and would prefer to find a community with the facilities/aspects of their previous home such as cafes, schools, markets, healthcare facilities and transport. \n",

Such factors that the neighborhoods will be assesed on are house pricing, school ratings, crime rates, road connectivity, weather conditions, emergency responsiveness, water resource and recreational facilities. \n",
